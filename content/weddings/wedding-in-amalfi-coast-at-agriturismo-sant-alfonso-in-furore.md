      ## The wedding

      Jordan & Nicolas celebrated their wedding at [Agriturismo Sant’Alfonso](https://www.agriturismosantalfonso.it/) in the Amalfi Coast, a 17th-century farmhouse. After a moving ceremony, they’ve had a typical Italian dinner in the ancient cantina of the house. The table setting was definitely stunning, thanks to the designer Franco Acampora, he did an amazing job and created such a charming atmosphere in a perfect autumn style with flowers and fruits found in the woods of the mountains along the Coast.

      Congratulations and our biggest thanks to Jordan & Nicolas for sharing their gorgeous wedding with us, it has been such a pleasure to be there.

      ## What if your wedding day is foggy and rainy?

      Jordan & Nicolas from the United States have had an amazing intimate wedding in Furore, a lovely village along the Amalfi Coast, with their closest families and friends surrounded by nature in a “not usual” Italian landscape. The weather was really bad but none of us have been worried or scared by the rain or the fog, we’ve just enjoyed the day having fun and taking amazing pictures. This unusual atmosphere gave to the wedding even a unique charm.

      ## Getting married in the Amalfi Coast

      A classical Italian home with vineyards and a cozy atmosphere has been the ideal scenery of a day that was filled with emotional moments and rustic elegance. The private little chapel of the property has been the perfect frame for their traditional Greek wedding ceremony. We cried, we laughed.
